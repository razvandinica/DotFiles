# ~/.inputrc
# This file configures the behavior of the readline library, which is used by
# bash and other command-line tools for handling user input.

# --- History Search ---
# The following lines enable history searching with the Up and Down arrow keys.
# This allows you to type the beginning of a command and then use the arrow
# keys to cycle through matching commands in your history.
"\e[A": history-search-backward
"\e[B": history-search-forward

# The bindings below are the standard Ctrl+R and Ctrl+S for history search.
# They are commented out as the arrow key bindings above are often preferred.
#"\C-r": reverse-search-history
#"\C-s": forward-search-history

# --- Tab Completion ---
# This setting makes command and filename completion (using the Tab key)
# case-insensitive. For example, typing 'doc' and pressing Tab could complete
# to 'Documents'.
set completion-ignore-case on
